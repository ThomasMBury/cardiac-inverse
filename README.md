## Code capsule
The article is accompanied by a [code capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/3359094/tree) on Code Ocean, which provides a software environment and compute resources to do a reproducible run of the results reported in the paper. This removes the need to install the software environment yourself to reproduce the results.
